# 🚀 NLP Pipeline with SpaCy & TextBlob

## 📌 Project Overview
This project implements a **Natural Language Processing (NLP) pipeline** using **SpaCy** and **TextBlob**. It covers **text processing, named entity recognition (NER), sentiment analysis, rule-based matching, and more**, making it useful for **chatbots, search engines, sentiment analysis, and text summarization**.

## 🔥 Features
- **Tokenization** – Splitting text into words/sentences.
- **Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagging** – Identifying word categories.
- **Named Entity Recognition (NER)** – Extracting names, places, organizations.
- **Lemmatization** – Converting words to their base form.
- **Stop Words Removal** – Removing unimportant words.
- **Text Similarity** – Comparing text similarity scores.
- **Rule-Based Matching** – Finding text patterns.
- **Sentiment Analysis** – Detecting positive/negative sentiment.
- **Text Summarization** – Extracting key points from text.
- **Dependency Parsing** – Analyzing sentence structures.

## 📂 Installation
Install the required dependencies:

bash
pip install spacy textblob
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
